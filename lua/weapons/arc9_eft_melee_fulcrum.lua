Like the original FULCRUM, this bayonet is extremely versatile and strong. The tanto-shaped blade allows for large amounts of work and wear while still keeping a sharp edge at its exceedingly sturdy tip. This feature, combined with a sharp false edge, makes the knife retain sufficient combat penetration capability to engage targets covered in heavy clothing, padding, or soft ballistic protections. Thanks to its weight and top-heavy balancing, the FULCRUM BAYONET blade is suitable for hard work on the field.]]
